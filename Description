Smooth flow in supply chains and accuracy of demand forecasting is vital. Access to products such as food 
and pharmaceuticals are very important during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic creates uncertainty in 
product demands and disruption in certain supply chains in the US. The purpose of this project is to both 
determine and predict the fluctuations in the food demand and production capacities in the US during the 
pandemic in accordance with COVID-19 data. 

The questions that the project will answer: Which food product has the most demand during COVID-19 for a 
certain destination in the US? What is the demand forecast of food products for COVID-19? What is the 
relationship between the COVID-19 population metrics and the production capacities of certain food products?

Three different datasets are used for the initial analysis. The commodity flow survey (CFS) dataset includes
yearly information of freight shipments in the US for different industries. This data is used to determine 
the local demand and production capacities in the US for food products. CFS data is available for years 
1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017. The second dataset is USDA’s monthly production data for food products. 
This data is important to obtain the overall capacity for production in the US for a certain food product. 
When this information is combined with the first dataset, it is possible to locate the food production 
capacities in the US states. Third dataset is the daily Covid-19 data provided by Johns Hopkins. 
This data is important for analyzing the relationship between the new cases/ death rates and the production 
capacity or demand fluctuations. Upon these analysis, it is possible to forecast the demand and the production 
capacities for the food products in the US during the pandemic.

As a result of the initial analysis of CFS data, the most demanded food product(in dollars) in both 2012 and 
2007 is meat products. Considering this finding and the news that mention the disruption in the meat production 
in the US, I made analysis for the meat demand and production capacity in the US. After the observation of the 
meat production data, using time series forecasting methods such as Exponential Smoothing is appropriate. 
The predictive modelling showed that there is a negative correlation between the new cases and the meat production. 
You can find the related code in "Meat Production In the US" and "Predictive Modeling (confirmed cases
affecting meat production)" jupyter notebooks.

In addition, by using the "supply chain demand forecasting with exponential smoothing" code in “Supply_Chain_and_Demand_Forecast_COVID19" 
notebook in this repository, the forecast of the demands of the food products for COVID-19 will be found for each 
entity within the supply chain. This is useful for supply chain entities such as retailer, wholesaler, distributor 
and manufacturer to determine their demand, order quantity and production quantity of a specific product according 
to the bullwhip effect.

This project is beneficial to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on food supply chains quantitatively and determine 
short term actions in order to prevent the stoppage in both the flow of supply chains and manufacturing of different
products in local facilities. The project offers useful information for post-Covid19 supply chain forecasts and 
planning for future epidemics/pandemics.

The findings from data at this stage of the project are:

-The most demanded product in a certain US location in a certain year.
-Predictive modelling showing the relationship between meat production capacity  and Covid-19 data.
-Supply chain simulation for demand forecasts with three different exponential smoothing forecast methods with random 
initial data for retailer demands. Since we disregard at least the first 1000 iterations of the simulation this 
data doesn't affect the results.

Future Steps:
-Including the analysis of the effects of lockdown period on the production and supply capacities for certain 
food products.
-Including the death rates in the predictive modelling. 
-Demand and production forecasts per state and the US in general
-Using 2017 Commodity Flow Survey data in forecasts upon its release
-Online update of the forecast according to the new daily Covid-19 cases and deaths data
-Findings about what portion of the food supply belongs to which state according to years 
-Exploring the relationship between population metrics and demand or production capacity fluctuations for a 
similar historic event such as Swine Flu or Influenza.
