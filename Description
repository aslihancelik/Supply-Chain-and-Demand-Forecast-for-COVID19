Smooth flow in supply chains and accuracy of demand forecasting is vital. 
Products such as food and pharmaceuticals are very important during the COVID-19. 

The project will answer questions like : What product has the most demand during COVID-19 
lockdown for a certain destination? What is the demand forecast of this product under COVID-19 circumstances?

The data from the https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2012/econ/cfs/2012-pums-files.html link 
can be used to determine the local production capacities of important products such as 
pharmaceuticals during quarantine period. This data can be related to COVID-19 demands by using 
time series forecasting methods such as Exponential Smoothing. The most recent data is from 2012. 
The data includes attributes related to freight shipments for all US states in different industry categories.

To calculate the demand values per highly preferred products during lockdown, the freight shipment 
data for different products in 2012 will be used. In addition, by using the "supply chain demand 
forecasting with exponential smoothing" code that the GitHub link provided in "link to 2nd asset", 
the forecast of demands of these important products for COVID-19 lockdown period will be found. 
This project can be helpful to determine short term actions in order to prevent the stoppage in 
both the flow of supply chains and manufacturing of different products in local facilities.

The analysis of the data which will be conducted throughout the project will be used to both 
determine the customer demand for a product and the manufacturing amount for the facility 
during COVID-19.

Throughout the project we will not only calculate the forecast but also determine the 
necessary amounts such as demand, order quantity and production quantity of a specific 
product according to the bullwhip effect among entities such as retailer, wholesaler, 
distributor and manufacturer .

The observations done on the data at this stage of the project are:
(The results can be found in the Jupyter notebook link available on "Link to 1st asset") 

- Finding the most demanded product in a certain location.
- Finding the location that pharmaceutical products demanded the most.
-Supply chain simulation for demands forecasts with 3 different exponential smoothing forecast methods
with random initial data for retailer demands. Since we disregard at least the first 1000 iterations 
of the simulation this data doesn't affect the results.
-Histograms of Product Demands 
-Plots for "Orders vs Time" and "Standard Deviation of Orders " are available in the Jupyter notebook.

Future Steps:
-Supply Chain simulation will be run for certain products with the demand data from the data set in order 
to determine the demand for vital products during COVID-19 lockdown.
-Demand will be calculated by using both shipment weight of the order for a certain product and unit weight of the product.
